## Typography

The default font of Resonant is **[Overpass](http://overpassfont.org/)**, loaded via Google Fonts. It uses three weights: Regular, Semibold and Bold, as well as their italics.

* **Source Serif Pro**, Regular and Bold, loaded via Google Fonts. The italics are loaded as webfonts (they aren't available on Google). Used for body text.
* **News Cycle** (Regular), via Google Fonts. Used for headings.
* **Archivo Narrow** (Semibold), via Google Fonts. Used as bolder counterpart to News Cycle.
* **Monoist**, for code samples.
